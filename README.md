2. Data Analysis and Querying

* Tool: SQL
* Purpose: Employed SQL to perform complex queries on the cleaned dataset. This facilitated efficient data manipulation, aggregation, and extraction of specific insights, such as identifying top-selling products and analyzing sales trends over time.
3. Data Visualization and Reporting

* Tool: Power BI
* Purpose: Utilized Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. This enabled a comprehensive representation of the data, highlighting key metrics like sales performance across branches, product profitability, and customer purchasing behavior, thereby aiding in informed decision-making.
4. Pivot Tables
  
* Tool: Excel
* Purpose: Created PivotTables to summarize sales data and identify patterns.

## 📂 Data Sources
* Sales Dataset: The dataset for this project was gotten from Kaggle,an online platform for data science and machine learning that provides
thousands of free datasets for practice. The dataset contains key details such as:
* Sales ID	(Unique ID for each transaction)
* Branch (Store location)
* City (where the branch is located)
* Customer Type (Member/Non-Member)
* Gender (Customer's gender)
* Product Name (Name of the product sold)
* Product Category (Category of the product)
* Unit Price (Price per unit)
* Quantity (Number of units purchased)
* Tax (Tax applied to the sale)
* Total Price (Final price after tax)
* Reward Points (Points earned per purchase)
## Aim of this Project
  The primary aim of this project are as follows:
  - Visualize Sales Trends: Utilize Excel's Pivot Tables and Charts to create visual representations of sales data, highlighting significant patterns and outliers.
  - Explore Customer Purchase Behavior: Analyze purchasing patterns based on customer demographics such as gender, and geographical factors like branch and city.
  - Interactive Supermarket Dashboard: Design an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
## Processes
- Step 1: Data Cleaning Tools(Excel): Reviewed the dataset for missing or inconsistent entries and made necessary corrections to ensure data accuracy.I also addressed inconsistencies where certain products were assigned incorrect categories—for example, instances where a product like "Shampoo" was mistakenly categorized under "Fruits." To rectify these errors, I utilized Excel's Find and Replace feature. This process ensured that each product was accurately categorized, thereby enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.
