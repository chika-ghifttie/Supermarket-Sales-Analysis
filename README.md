## üõ† Tools Used
* Excel: Data cleaning, Pivot Table analysis
* SQL: Queries for data exploration
* Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
## üìÇ Data Sources
* Sales Dataset: The dataset for this project was gotten from Kaggle,an online platform for data science and machine learning that provides
thousands of free datasets for practice. The dataset contains key details such as:
* Sales ID	(Unique ID for each transaction)

## Aim of this Project
  The primary aim of this project are as follows:
  - Visualize Sales Trends: Utilize Excel's Pivot Tables and Charts to create visual representations of sales data, highlighting significant patterns and outliers.
  - Explore Customer Purchase Behavior: Analyze purchasing patterns based on customer demographics such as gender, and geographical factors like branch and city.
  - Interactive Supermarket Dashboard: Design an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
## Processes
- Step 1: Data Cleaning Tools(Excel): Reviewed the dataset for missing or inconsistent entries and made necessary corrections to ensure data accuracy.I also addressed inconsistencies where certain products were assigned incorrect categories‚Äîfor example, instances where a product like "Shampoo" was mistakenly categorized under "Fruits." To rectify these errors, I utilized Excel's Find and Replace feature. This process ensured that each product was accurately categorized, thereby enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.
